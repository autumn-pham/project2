USER STORIES:
Sometimes it's hard to keep track of your workouts. My app allows users to log their workout and then see the amount of calories they burned doing it. This will hold them accountable. If they are new to working on, they can get some quick ideas. They can also "shop" for some products.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Express, EJS, Heroku

APPROACH TAKEN:
Tackled MVPs first with just a workout log, got all the routes up and running and deployed. Added extra pages and CSS styling after. Incorporated 3rd party API last.

NOTES TO MYSELF:
Responsive design viewport (did not know that was a thing). It would be cool to have users be able to save their favorite recipes and have only their workout logs appear in the future instead of everything that goes into the database. Better graphics, videos demonstrating workouts. Real shop would also be nice.
Input type options with bootstrap figure out how to get that into req.body.type in workouts controller. Did not work.
