USER STORIES:
Sometimes it's hard to keep track of your workouts. My app allows users to log their workout and then see the amount of calories they burned doing it. This will hold them accountable. If they are new to working on, they can get some quick ideas. They can also "shop" for some products.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Heroku

APPROACH TAKEN:
Tackled MVPs first with just a workout log, got all the routes up and running and deployed. Added extra pages and CSS styling after.

NOTES TO MYSELF:
Would love to use third-party API to allow users to search a database of healthy meal options.
